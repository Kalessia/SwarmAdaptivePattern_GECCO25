# SwarmAdaptivePattern_GECCO25
This project implements the evolutionary algorithm **CMA-ES to evolve the optimal robot controller** (D), enabling it to **reproduce a phenotypic pattern** at the swarm scale, matching the **visual display target** (A). The swarm of **moving robots** is modeled in an original **sliding-puzzle setup** (C) — a grid where each cell can either be occupied by an autonomous robot or remain empty. This **distributed system** is characterized by two parameters: **density**, which refers to the number of robots relative to the total available positions in the grid; and **fluidity**, which represents the probability of an agent moving to a nearby empty position at each time step. **Communication between robots is local**, occurring through **signal exchanges** in a **neighbor-to-neighbor von Neumann topology** (D).

## **To run an experiment: Learning, Swarm (generalization), and Plots**

-   Set the learning and generalization parameters by modifying <u>learning_params.json</u> and <u>swarm_params.json</u>. The parameters are already settled to reproduce the paper results.
-   In the Bash script <u>launch.sh</u>, uncomment the lines that you wish to run. If you run <u>learning_main.py</u> only, you can later execute <u>swarm_main.py</u> or the analysis scripts by commenting out <u>learning_main.py</u> and filling the <u>learning_analysis_dir</u> and <u>swarm_analysis_dir</u> fields.
-   From the *src* directory, execute the Bash script <u>launch.sh</u>:
    `~/SwarmAdaptivePattern_GECCO25/src$ ./launch.sh` 
-   The results will be stored in a newly created <u>simulationAnalysis</u> folder.


## Details
- In the function <u>plot_flag</u> in <u>environments.py</u>: the plot of the signal pattern does not work for <u>grid_nb_rows</u> ≤ 10 and <u>grid_nb_cols</u> ≤ 10 because signal values can be negative. **Easy fix**: comment out the special debug display for small grids.
